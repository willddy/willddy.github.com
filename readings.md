###Hadoop: The Definitive Guide
###☆☆☆☆☆
#####Big Data Area
* Level Ent.
* Level Mid. 
* Level Adv. 

This is a really a good Hadoop book to recommend. I have read both 2nd and 3rd edition. The latest 3rd edition is based on the Hadoop 1.0. It covers almost everything on the Hadoop including Yarn. The author also has <a href="https://github.com/tomwhite/hadoop-book/" target="_blank"> github site </a> to share the code.

###Hadoop In Practice 
###☆☆☆☆☆
#####Big Data Area
* Level Mid.  
* Level Adv.  

This is pretty good book, especially in the data science chapter. The hive part is a little bit old than other latest Hadoop book. The reading experience is also good. I like the way it provides number of "TECHNIQUE". It touches some new tool of big data that other books do not cover, such as Cloudera Crunch. There are no comments in the source code (request by publication), but there are enough comments added inline in the book.

###Hadoop Real World Solution Cookbook
###☆☆☆☆
#####Big Data Area
* Level Mid. 
* Level Adv.

The code has no comments with explanation below. The way is really not I like. If put the comments in code, the book may have less pages to read. In addition, there are logic mistakes in the book because copy & paste error I think at least three – five time after I read 100s of pages, eg. p143 “hashset” should be “hashmap”. The charpter 7 starts looking good and deep which requires your knowledge on data mining and graph processing. This is a good tool reference book anyway

###Hadoop 实战
###☆☆☆
#####Big Data Area 
* Level Ent. 

This book is a Chinese book which has same name to below but with totally different. It covers majority Hadoop components and reading friendly. I only read the 1st edition, so the things are a little out of date. The 2ed is also on the shelf right now. Generally, it is just introduction and lacks of details and high skills.

###Hadoop MapReduce Cookbook</h2>
###☆☆☆</h2>
#####Big Data Area</h3>
* Level Ent.
* Level Mid. 
* Level Adv. 
    
Some sample Hadoop commands lack of necessary space between command/parameters. In Ch8, it provide some data analytics implementation using Java and MapReduce, which I did not see details like this in other books. It it worthy more time of reading this part.

###MapReduce Design Patterns
###☆☆☆
#####Big Data Area
* Level Mid.  
* Level Adv.  

The topic is really focus. The pattern is not that exciting comparing with Java’s in description. There is small values if you already read below other books. There are typos and mistakes. I cannot find the source code either.

###Programming Pig</h2>
###☆☆☆☆</h2>
#####Big Data Area</h3>
* Level Mid.  
* Level Adv.  

This is a tiny book about pig, around 200 pages. It covers everything. The extension of UDF parts lacks of enough examples. Also, these parts are a little bit hard for reading. I have also read the translation one, which is so so. You cannot find more examples of Pig than anywhere else. However, I expect there is another book I believe that could/should cover more practical examples and hands on scripts.

###Geting Good with GIT
###☆☆☆

* Level Ent. 

This is a tiny book for Git. It is good because it is short and simple.
