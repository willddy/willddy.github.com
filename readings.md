This is a really a good Hadoop book to recommend. I have read both 2nd and 3rd edition. The latest 3rd edition is based on the Hadoop 1.0. It covers almost everything on the Hadoop including Yarn. The author also has <a href="https://github.com/tomwhite/hadoop-book/" target="_blank"> github site </a> to share the code. Here is my [book note](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s36/sh/79d59799-3254-43a8-a316-e38e4760e3c8/a721c419a7cab4dd2592de6bc16203d4)

This is pretty good book, especially in the data science chapter. The hive part is a little bit old than other latest Hadoop book. The reading experience is also good. I like the way it provides number of "TECHNIQUE". It touches some new tool of big data that other books do not cover, such as Cloudera Crunch. There are no comments in the source code (request by publication), but there are enough comments added inline in the book.

The code has no comments with explanation below. The way is really not I like. If put the comments in code, the book may have less pages to read. In addition, there are logic mistakes in the book because copy & paste error I think at least three – five time after I read 100s of pages, eg. p143 “hashset” should be “hashmap”. The charpter 7 starts looking good and deep which requires your knowledge on data mining and graph processing. This is a good tool reference book anyway

This book is a Chinese book which has same name to below but with totally different. It covers majority Hadoop components and reading friendly. I only read the 1st edition, so the things are a little out of date. The 2ed is also on the shelf right now. Generally, it is just introduction and lacks of details and high skills.

Some sample Hadoop commands lack of necessary space between command/parameters. In Ch8, it provide some data analytics implementation using Java and MapReduce, which I did not see details like this in other books. It it worthy more time of reading this part.

The topic is really focus. The pattern is not that exciting comparing with Java’s in description. There is small values if you already read below other books. There are typos and mistakes. I cannot find the source code either.

This is a tiny book about pig, around 200 pages. It covers everything. The extension of UDF parts lacks of enough examples. Also, these parts are a little bit hard for reading. I have also read the translation one, which is so so. You cannot find more examples of Pig than anywhere else. However, I expect there is another book I believe that could/should cover more practical examples and hands on scripts.

This book tells how map and reduce are implemented in source code level. It covers lots of detail that other book never mentioned. It can help reading the source code. This is kind of book helping uderstanding instead of practicing something. There are less code samples with book. The picture and comparing form in this book are really good for reading and undersanding.

This book is for HBase administrators, developers, and will even help Hadoop administrators. You are not required to have HBase experience, but are expected to have a basic understanding of Hadoop and MapReduce. This is very practical tookit book for HBase admin. It does not talk more about API and focus on administration only.

This is a really a good HBase book to recommend. This is the 1st edition and shows you how Apache HBase can fulfill your needs. As the open source implementation of Google's BigTable architecture, HBase scales to billions of rows and millions of columns, while ensuring that write and read performance remain constant. The author also has <a href="https://github.com/larsgeorge/hbase-book" target="_blank"> github site </a> to share the code. I am still in reading for now and it is a little bit hard.

It is one of few books of big data using real example to tell what's revolution brought by big data. The signatures of big data it describes are really impressive. This book motives readers to explore the value behind of big data. It is a good book to encourage people to explore the big data area.

This is a tiny book for Git. It is good because it is short and simple. It covers basic usage of Git and a little about GitHub. It is particular good for people who want to learn Git from Zero. The is another link about GitHub call [GotGitHub](http://www.worldhello.net/gotgithub/), which is also recommended reading after this. The only pity is that it does not cover any advanced topics. Here is my [my book note](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s36/sh/f2cf70fa-6f1c-483b-9eab-23e52462f09e/4a50f05a3852edeb5a5fca7d03ed8d87)

This is a complete beginner's workflow for version control of common documents and content. It has examples used are from non-techie, day to day computing activities for Git enter and middle level. It covers basic usage of Git and a little about Bitbucket in chapter 4. This book has very dtail of git command in terms of command output and how to run it in both git GUI and CLI.

This is a few books having details about Maven 3, which is am excellent Java project management tools. This book not only cover the basic knowledge of maven, but also introduce related tools, like Hudson. In addition, there are more good maven readings such as, [Maven Complete Reference](http://books.sonatype.com/mvnref-book/reference/index.html), and [Maven Tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/maven/)

In quick reading. This is a good begining guide for fresh people in linux programming. It is also a good quick review book. I never learn linux form books but from using experence and system manuals. This is a a free book which is recommanded to read to learn lLinux in systematic way.
