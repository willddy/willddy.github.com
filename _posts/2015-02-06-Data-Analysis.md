A friend of mine asked me what is data analysis. This is a simple but difficult question. It is simple because we talk about data analysis all the time and everywhere. It is difficult because there are so many ways of explaining it at different time. In the ear of big data, I think data analysis have three follwing areas.

* Flatten Analysis
* Dimentional Analysis
* Iterational Analysis
