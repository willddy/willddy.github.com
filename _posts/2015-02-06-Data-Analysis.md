A friend of mine asked me what is data analysis. This is a simple but difficult question. It is simple because we talk about data analysis all the time and everywhere. It is difficult because there are so many ways of explaining it at different time. In the ear of big data, I think data analysis have three following areas.

* Flatten Analysis: Analysis is performed on the static data set from single dimentional view. Most analysis are simple enough focusing on the fixed scope of data. It is more or less like statistics, such as total, average, standard devidations, etc. Simple SQL or Excel tools can be used to do flatten data analysis.

* Dimentional Analysis

* Iterational Analysis
