It is great to see that Brew supports install Spark. It makes installation of Spark quite easier in Mac. I just follow few steps to get my spark instance installed locally.
####1. Install brew utility.

```
mymac:$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
==> This script will install:
/usr/local/bin/brew
/usr/local/Library/...
/usr/local/share/man/man1/brew.1
==> The following directories will be made group writable:
/usr/local/.
/usr/local/bin
==> The following directories will have their group set to admin:
/usr/local/.
/usr/local/bin

Press RETURN to continue or any other key to abort
==> /usr/bin/sudo /bin/chmod g+rwx /usr/local/. /usr/local/bin
Password:
==> /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/chgrp admin /usr/local/. /usr/local/bin
==> /usr/bin/sudo /bin/mkdir /Library/Caches/Homebrew
==> /usr/bin/sudo /bin/chmod g+rwx /Library/Caches/Homebrew

####2. Install the spark from Brew
